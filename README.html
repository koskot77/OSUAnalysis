This package does the last stage of skimming converting BEANs into flat "micro" ntuples.
The original version of the code was started in 2010 by Lukaz Kreczko. In 2011-2012 it
was taken over and supported by Carl Vuosalo. In 2012-2013 I adapted this code for my
monotop analysis. No refactoring was ever done to this code so it may be hard to browse.
The root directory also hosts several auxiliary .C root macros and code for the statistics
model. You can start browsing by clicking <a href="https://github.com/koskot77/OSUAnalysis">here</a>
